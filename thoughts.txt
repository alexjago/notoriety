# Mass ballot stats by ticket (above-the-line)

Trying to determine two things: popularity and recognition. 

Popularity might be approximated by 'number of ballots listing party in top 6'

Recognition is a little more difficult because you can safely assume (almost) all the Greens and LNP voters know of the other party... 
but even in the ACT only 59% of Greens3PP voters preferenced the Libs *at all* and only 52% Lib3PP voters did the reverse. 
Then again, if you look for 'pref'd *at all*' the figures are in the mid-70s for Libs and Greens, and 91% fo Labor. 
So perhaps a binary classification - more than 50% of ballots have you preferenced and then people know who you are. 

Notoriety is also possible: number of ballots preferencing you *lower than halfway down the full ballot*.
